	abstract = {Background: Rapamycin has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in preclinical Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD) models, yet clinical data remain limited. Here, we conducted a pilot trial to assess the feasibility and safety of rapamycin treatment in early-stage AD using multimodal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Methods: This single-arm, open-label pilot study enrolled 14 participants with early-stage AD who received oral rapamycin 7 mg weekly for 26 weeks. Thirteen participants completed treatment. The primary outcome was change in cerebral glucose metabolism measured by [18F]FDG PET (Ki and SUVR) in pre-specified regions commonly affected in AD: posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and temporoparietal cortex. Secondary outcomes included cerebral blood flow (CBF) via ASL MRI, concentration of CSF biomarkers, volumetric MRI, and cognition. Results: Rapamycin was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. No significant metabolic or perfusion changes were observed in primary regions. Exploratory analyses showed increases in [18F]FDG SUVR in the putamen, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamic CBF. Higher rapamycin blood concentrations correlated with increased [18F]FDG SUVR in several brain regions, including the temporoparietal cortex. CSF analysis showed significant increases in total tau, neurofilament light, ABeta40, and a numerical, non-significant increase in Abeta42 of similar effect size, while p-tau remained largely unchanged, resulting in a significantly decreased p-tau/total tau ratio. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates feasibility of rapamycin trials in AD. The primary [18F]FDG outcomes showed no decline, in contrast to what would be expected from natural disease progression The observed elevations in CSF biomarkers warrant further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT06022068Clinical Protocolshttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12883-024-03596-1Funding StatementThe study was supported by a Longevity Impetus grant from the Norn Group, {\r A}hlen Stiftelsen, Demensfonden, The Swedish Society of Medicine (SLS), {\r A}ke Wibergs Stiftelse (M24-0117), Loo and Hans Osterman Stiftelse, Stiftelsen f{\"o}r {\r A}lderssjukdomar Karolinska Institutet, Stiftelsen f{\"o}r Gamla Tj {\"a}narinnor, Tore Nilssons Stiftelse f{\"o}r Medicinsk Forskning, Magnus Bergvalls stiftelse, Karolinska Institutet Research Grants, Stiftelsen Stockholms Sjukhem, Region Stockholm (ALF grant), The Swedish Brain Foundation (PS2021-0012 and PD2024-0444-HK-155), and KI CIMED.

  abstract = {Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor used clinically for immunosuppression, shows promise for repurposing in age-related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the pharmacokinetics of daily rapamycin are well-characterized in transplant populations, limited data exist on intermittent dosing regimens in patients with neurodegenerative conditions.~This open-label pilot study investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of weekly oral rapamycin in 13 patients with early-stage AD. Participants received 7~mg weekly (11 patients) or reduced doses (2~mg and 4~mg; 2 patients) for 26~weeks. Blood concentrations were measured at four timepoints (pre-dose/Cmin, and 1-, 3-, and 48-h post-dose) during week 13.~Moderate interindividual variability was observed across timepoints (coefficient of variation was 0.28--0.40), with the 48-h sample showing the lowest variability (CoV\,=\,0.28) and strongest correlation with Cmin from the previous dosing (r\,=\,0.72). Estimate of terminal half-life (68.9\,\textpm\,13.6~h) aligned with previous studies.~Blood concentrations at Cmin were below immunosuppressive levels in all participants. Our findings suggest that weekly rapamycin administration in AD patients results in acceptable pharmacokinetic variability, supporting fixed-dose regimens in future trials. The 48-h post-dose measurement appears optimal for monitoring blood concentrations. Additionally, our investigation into cerebrospinal fluid rapamycin quantification revealed methodological challenges due to analytical sensitivity limitations. The foremost limitation of this study was the sparse blood sampling schedule, with Cmin collected from the previous dosing occasion which prevented a complete AUC-calculation.~ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06022068) and EudraCT (2023--000127--36).},
