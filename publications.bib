	abstract = {Cross-sectional brain age models have demonstrated high accuracy and reliability for predicting chronological age based on structural brain features derived from single MRI scans. However, these models cannot separate baseline variation from true aging-related changes or noise. Longitudinal models address this limitation by predicting inter-scan intervals from paired MRI scans, controlling for baseline factors through repeated measurements. Using OASIS-3 data, we compare a cross-sectional 3D CNN against three longitudinal architectures for predicting inter-scan intervals: LILAC (Siamese neural network), LILAC+ (enhanced Siamese network with multi-layer perceptron), and AM (variational autoencoder). Longitudinal models substantially outperformed the cross-sectional approach, with LILAC+ achieving best performance (MSE = 1.97 years^2, MAE = 0.99 years, r = 0.86, R^2 = 0.71). Our results suggest that direct modeling of longitudinal change is more effective at capturing individual aging trajectories than deriving intervals from cross-sectional predictions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used ONLY openly available human data that were originally located at: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/oasis3/I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
