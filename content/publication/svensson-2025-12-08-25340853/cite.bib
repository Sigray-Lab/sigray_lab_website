 abstract = {Background: Rapamycin has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in preclinical Alzheimer\textquoterights disease (AD) models, yet clinical data remain limited. Here, we conducted a pilot trial to assess the feasibility and safety of rapamycin treatment in early-stage AD using multimodal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Methods: This single-arm, open-label pilot study enrolled 14 participants with early-stage AD who received oral rapamycin 7 mg weekly for 26 weeks. Thirteen participants completed treatment. The primary outcome was change in cerebral glucose metabolism measured by [18F]FDG PET (Ki and SUVR) in pre-specified regions commonly affected in AD: posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and temporoparietal cortex. Secondary outcomes included cerebral blood flow (CBF) via ASL MRI, concentration of CSF biomarkers, volumetric MRI, and cognition. Results: Rapamycin was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. No significant metabolic or perfusion changes were observed in primary regions. Exploratory analyses showed increases in [18F]FDG SUVR in the putamen, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamic CBF. Higher rapamycin blood concentrations correlated with increased [18F]FDG SUVR in several brain regions, including the temporoparietal cortex. CSF analysis showed significant increases in total tau, neurofilament light, ABeta40, and a numerical, non-significant increase in Abeta42 of similar effect size, while p-tau remained largely unchanged, resulting in a significantly decreased p-tau/total tau ratio. Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates feasibility of rapamycin trials in AD. The primary [18F]FDG outcomes showed no decline, in contrast to what would be expected from natural disease progression The observed elevations in CSF biomarkers warrant further investigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT06022068Clinical Protocolshttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12883-024-03596-1Funding StatementThe study was supported by a Longevity Impetus grant from the Norn Group,  ̊Ahlen Stiftelsen, Demensfonden, The Swedish Society of Medicine (SLS), \Åke Wibergs Stiftelse (M24-0117), Loo and Hans Osterman Stiftelse, Stiftelsen för \r̊lderssjukdomar Karolinska Institutet, Stiftelsen för Gamla Tj änarinnor, Tore Nilssons Stiftelse för Medicinsk Forskning, Magnus Bergvalls stiftelse, Karolinska Institutet Research Grants, Stiftelsen Stockholms Sjukhem, Region Stockholm (ALF grant), The Swedish Brain Foundation (PS2021-0012 and PD2024-0444-HK-155), and KI CIMED.
