abstract: There is a growing interest in developing drugs with a general geroprotective
  effect, aimed at slowing down aging. Several compounds have been shown to increase
  the lifespan and reduce the incidence of age-related diseases in model organisms.
  Translating these results is challenging, due to the long lifespan of humans. To
  address this, we propose using a battery of medical imaging protocols that allow
  for assessments of age-related processes known to precede disease onset. These protocols,
  based on magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission-, computed-, and optical
  coherence tomography, are already in use in drug development and are available at
  most modern hospitals. Here, we outline how an informed use of these techniques
  allows for detecting changes in the accumulation of age-related pathologies in a
  diverse set of physiological systems. This in vivo imaging battery enables efficient
  screening of candidate geroprotective compounds in early phase clinical trials,
  within reasonable trial durations.
