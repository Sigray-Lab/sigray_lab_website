abstract: To better assess the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders and the efficacy
  of neuroprotective interventions, it is necessary to develop biomarkers that can
  accurately capture age-related biological changes in the human brain. Brain serotonin
  2A receptors (5-HT2AR) show a particularly profound age-related decline and are
  also reduced in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study
  investigates whether the decline in 5-HT2AR binding, measured in vivo using positron
  emission tomography (PET), can be used as a biomarker for brain aging. Specifically,
  we aim to (1) predict brain age using 5-HT2AR binding outcomes, (2) compare 5-HT2AR-based
  predictions of brain age to predictions based on gray matter (GM) volume, as determined
  with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (3) investigate whether combining
  5-HT2AR and GM volume data improves prediction. We used PET and MR images from 209
  healthy individuals aged between 18 and 85~years (mean,=,38, std,=,18) and estimated
  5-HT2AR binding and GM volume for 14 cortical and subcortical regions. Different
  machine learning algorithms were applied to predict chronological age based on 5-HT2AR
  binding, GM volume, and the combined measures. The mean absolute error (MAE) and
  a cross-validation approach were used for evaluation and model comparison. We find
  that both the cerebral 5-HT2AR binding (mean MAE,=,6.63~years, std,=,0.74~years)
  and GM volume (mean MAE,=,6.95~years, std,=,0.83~years) predict chronological age
  accurately. Combining the two measures improves the prediction further (mean MAE,=,5.54~years,
  std,=,0.68). In conclusion, 5-HT2AR binding measured using PET might be useful for
  improving the quantification of a biomarker for brain aging.
