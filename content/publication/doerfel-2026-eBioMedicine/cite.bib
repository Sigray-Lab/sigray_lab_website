 abstract = {Background
Brain age estimated from structural magnetic resonance images is commonly used as a biomarker of biological ageing and brain health. Ideally, as a clinically useful biomarker, brain age should indicate the current state of health and be predictive of future disease onset and detrimental changes in brain biology.
Methods
In this preregistered study, we evaluated and compared the clinical utility, i.e., diagnostic and prognostic performance, of six publicly available brain age prediction packages using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
Findings
Baseline brain age differed significantly between groups consisting of individuals with normal cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease for all packages, but with comparable performance to estimates of grey matter volume. Further, brain age estimates were not centred around zero for participants with normal cognition and showed considerable variation between packages. Finally, brain age was only weakly correlated with disease onset, memory decline, and grey matter atrophy within four years from baseline in individuals without neurodegenerative disease.
Interpretation
The systematic discrepancy between chronological age and brain age among healthy subjects, combined with the weak associations between brain age and longitudinal changes in memory performance or grey matter volume, suggests that the current brain age estimates have limited clinical utility as a biomarker for biological ageing.
