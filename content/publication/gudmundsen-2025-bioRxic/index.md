abstract: Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), has
  shown promise as a neuroprotective compound in preclinical studies. Reduced brain
  glucose metabolism and loss of synaptic density are key features of Alzheimertextquoterights
  disease that can be measured in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging,
  allowing for assessment of treatment effects on brain function. Here, we used PET
  to investigate the acute effects of a single-dose of rapamycin on glucose metabolism
  and synaptic density in Long-Evans rats. In a repeated measures design, we quantified
  changes in brain glucose metabolism using [18F]FDG PET (n=13) at baseline, one day,
  and one week after intraperitoneal administration of rapamycin (8 mg/kg). In a separate
  cohort (n=6), we measured synaptic density using [18F]SynVesT-1 PET at baseline
  and one day after rapamycin administration. Regional standardized uptake values
  (SUV) were calculated for [18F]FDG while total distribution volumes were estimated
  for [18F]SynVesT-1 using image-derived input functions of the heart. Rapamycin induced
  significant increases in [18F]FDG SUV across multiple brain regions one day after
  administration, an effect that persisted at one-week follow-up. In contrast, [18F]SynVesT-1
  binding showed significant decreases throughout the brain at 24 hours post-administration,
  indicating reduced synaptic density. These opposing effects on glucose metabolism
  and synaptic density point to multifaceted actions of rapamycin in the brain, possibly
  reflecting improved metabolic function occurring simultaneously with acute synaptic
  loss. These results show that [18F]FDG and synaptic density PET imaging could serve
  as useful biomarkers in human clinical trials evaluating rapamycintextquoterights
  mechanistic and therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative disorders.Competing Interest
