abstract: Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor used clinically for immunosuppression, shows
  promise for repurposing in age-related disorders, including Alzheimer's disease
  (AD). While the pharmacokinetics of daily rapamycin are well-characterized in transplant
  populations, limited data exist on intermittent dosing regimens in patients with
  neurodegenerative conditions.~This open-label pilot study investigated the pharmacokinetic
  properties of weekly oral rapamycin in 13 patients with early-stage AD. Participants
  received 7~mg weekly (11 patients) or reduced doses (2~mg and 4~mg; 2 patients)
  for 26~weeks. Blood concentrations were measured at four timepoints (pre-dose/Cmin,
  and 1-, 3-, and 48-h post-dose) during week 13.~Moderate interindividual variability
  was observed across timepoints (coefficient of variation was 0.28--0.40), with the
  48-h sample showing the lowest variability (CoV,=,0.28) and strongest correlation
  with Cmin from the previous dosing (r,=,0.72). Estimate of terminal half-life (68.9,textpm,13.6~h)
  aligned with previous studies.~Blood concentrations at Cmin were below immunosuppressive
  levels in all participants. Our findings suggest that weekly rapamycin administration
  in AD patients results in acceptable pharmacokinetic variability, supporting fixed-dose
  regimens in future trials. The 48-h post-dose measurement appears optimal for monitoring
  blood concentrations. Additionally, our investigation into cerebrospinal fluid rapamycin
  quantification revealed methodological challenges due to analytical sensitivity
  limitations. The foremost limitation of this study was the sparse blood sampling
  schedule, with Cmin collected from the previous dosing occasion which prevented
  a complete AUC-calculation.~ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06022068) and EudraCT (2023--000127--36).
