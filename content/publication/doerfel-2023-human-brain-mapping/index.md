abstract: "Brain age prediction algorithms using structural magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) aim to assess the biological age of the human brain. The difference
  between a person's chronological age and the estimated brain age is thought to reflect
  deviations from a normal aging trajectory, indicating a slower or accelerated biological
  aging process. Several pre-trained software packages for predicting brain age are
  publicly available. In this study, we perform a comparison of such packages with
  respect to (1) predictive accuracy, (2) test–retest reliability, and (3) the ability
  to track age progression over time. We evaluated the six brain age prediction packages:
  brainageR, DeepBrainNet, brainage, ENIGMA, pyment, and mccqrnn. The accuracy and
  test–retest reliability were assessed on MRI data from 372 healthy people aged between
  18.4 and 86.2 years (mean 38.7 ± 17.5 years). All packages showed significant correlations
  between predicted brain age and chronological age (r = 0.66–0.97, p < 0.001), with
  pyment displaying the strongest correlation. The mean absolute error was between
  3.56 (pyment) and 9.54 years (ENIGMA). brainageR, pyment, and mccqrnn were superior
  in terms of reliability (ICC values between 0.94–0.98), as well as predicting age
  progression over a longer time span. Of the six packages, pyment and brainageR consistently
  showed the highest accuracy and test–retest reliability."
