        At the **Imaging Biomarkers of Biological Aging Group** we aim to develop and validate biomarkers of biological aging using neuroimaging, and machine learning. The overarging goal is to develop frameworks for clinical trials assessing the effect of putative geroprotective compounds.  this includes the development of protocols for imaging studies and the development and validation of potential biomarkers.
